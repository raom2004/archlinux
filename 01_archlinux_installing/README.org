#  Bash script that automates archlinux install 
#  This script can create discrete partitions for:
#   * /boot to install boot loaader for BIOS/GPT
#   * /home for user files
#   * /     for system files
#   * /recovery a rsycn backup of "/" for testing and recovery

## ARCHLINUX PARTITIONING AND MOUNTING: Basic concepts 
#
# The most basic archlinux install can be done in one drive, for example
# "/dev/sda". So we can create a unique partition "/dev/sda1" and install
# the entire system in a unique mountpoint, called root "/". 
# The /etc/fstab scheme for this archlinux install, will look like this:
#   /dev/sda2    /         ext4    rw,relatime    0 1
#
# But archlinux can have more mount options instead of the root "/" alone.
# The most frequent individual mountpoints, are:
#  /        the root directory, that stores all the files and directories.
#  /boot    the boot directory, contains the boot loader, e.g. GRUB.
#  /home    a home directory, that storesa all the user personal data.
# Important: each mountpoint require an individual partition.
#
# Archlinux promote such separete scheme, because it has advantages:
#  An individual /boot is useful to support BIOS/GPT and UEFI/GPT.
#  An individual /home is useful to share user files.
#  An individual / is useful to restore or recover the system
#   without messing up the other mountpoints (like /boot and /home).
#
# Separated mountpoints also allow to you to set more restrictive
# options for each mountpoint. For this reason, Archlinux security promote
# to use of the mentioned mountpoints, and others, like: 
#  /var     for variable data files, like system logging, user caches, etc
#  /dev/shm a world-writeble directory to store user files in memory  
#  /tmp     temporal files
# These separated mountpoints allow you to improbe Archlinux security

## STANDARD PARTITIONING SCHEME USED IN THIS ARCHLINUX INSTALLER:
#
# In this installer we use a simple scheme with 3 different partitions
# and mountpoints, like this /etc/fstab:
#  /dev/sda3    /         ext4    rw,relatime    0 1
#  /dev/sda1    /boot     ext2    rw,relatime    0 2
#  /dev/sda2    /home     ext4    rw,relatime    0 2
# The /etc/fstab will be used for the bootloader to mount the system

## THE RECOVERY PARTITION:
#
# We will duplicate the root "/" mountpoint from /dev/sda3
# into /dev/sda4. And we will update the /etc/fstab in /dev/sda4,
# to look like this:
#  /dev/sda4    /         ext4    rw,relatime    0 1
#  /dev/sda1    /boot     ext2    rw,relatime    0 2
#  /dev/sda2    /home     ext4    rw,relatime    0 2
# Finally, we will update our bootloader configuration, to work properly.
# This way we will have to booteable root "/" mountpoints, ready for
# testing purposes or recover the system
